= jspwebapp

A simple JSP web application to explore multi-wars deployment with Tomcat.
See `tomcat-hello-base` for tomcat deployment setup.

== Build and Run

  cd jspwebapp-parent
  mvn package dependency:copy-dependencies
  tomcat-base/bin/run.sh
  open http://localhost:8080

== Tomcat Session Notes

We can make multi wars shared the same session ID, but the content stored attributes are not shared!
To be able to share same session ID accross multiple wars in Tomcat, you need to add the following
to the `conf/context.xml` file:

    <Context sessionCookiePath="/">
    </Context>
