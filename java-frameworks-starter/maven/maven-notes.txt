= Notes for Maven 3.5.3 (2018-03-25)

== Effective pom

  mvn help;effective-pom

== Maven Archetype

Use archetype to generate new project. There is a `create-project.sh` script
to help pre-type the long command line options!

Note unfortunately the default `maven-archetype-plugin` generates very
basic and outdated default project settings. Example default compile
to Java 1.5 and using JUnit3! User need to manaully update these after
the project is generated to something more modern.
