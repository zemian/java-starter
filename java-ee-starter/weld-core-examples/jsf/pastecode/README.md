Weld PasteCode Example
======================

This example demonstrates the use of Weld in Java EE Environment. Contextual
state management and dependency injection are handled by JSR-299. Transaction
and persistence context management is handled by the EJB 3 container. All services
are self-contained within the deployment.

Weld Features Covered
---------------------
- injecting into POJO, EJB (SFSB), Servlet
- `@ApplicationScoped`, `@Model`, `@SessionScoped` annotations
- producer named methods
- Decorators

Deploying to WildFly
--------------------
Make sure you have assigned the absolute path of your installation to the
`JBOSS_HOME` environment variable.

1. Open terminal and start the server by running script:

        $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh

2. Deploy example to the server you have started in step 1 using command

        mvn wildfly:deploy

3. Now you can view the application at <http://localhost:8080/weld-pastecode>.


To run functional tests execute:

    mvn verify -Darquillian=wildfly-managed
