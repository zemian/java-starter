Weld Translator Example
=======================

This example demonstrates the use of Weld in a Servlet container (Tomcat)
or as a non-EJB application for a Java EE server (WildFly). 
No alterations are expected to be made to the container. All services are 
self-contained within the deployment.

Deploying to WildFly
--------------------

Make sure you have assigned the absolute path of your installation to the
`JBOSS_HOME` environment variable.

1. Open terminal and start the server by running script:

        $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh

2. Install the parent using command:

        mvn install -f ../../pom.xml

3. Deploy this example to the server you have started in step 1 using command

        mvn wildfly:deploy -f ear/pom.xml

4. Now you can view the application at <http://localhost:8080/weld-translator>.


To run functional tests execute:

    mvn verify -Darquillian=wildfly-managed -f ftest/pom.xml
