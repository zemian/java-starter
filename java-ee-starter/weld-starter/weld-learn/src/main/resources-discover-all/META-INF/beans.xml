A bean archive has a bean discovery mode of all, annotated or none. A bean archive
which contains abeans.xml  file  with  no  version  has  a  default  bean  discovery
mode  of  all.  A  bean  archive  which contains  a  beans.xml  file  with  version  1.1
(or  later)  must  specify  the  bean-discovery-mode  attribute.The default value
for the attribute is annotated

bean-discovery-mode:

    'annotated' - loosely translated, means that only components with a class-level annotation are processed.
    'all' - all components are processed, just like they were in Java EE 6 with the explicit beans.xml.
    'none' - CDI is effectively disabled.
