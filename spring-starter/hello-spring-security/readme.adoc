= Spring Security

This is a SpringMVC project to explore Spring Security.

We have pre-populated some test users for this demo using `db/create-schema.sql`. All of the passwords are same
as their username value.

* `admin` - has the `ADMIN` role
* `test` - has the `USER` role
* `test2` - has the `USER` role
* `test3` - has the `USER` role but is disabled.
