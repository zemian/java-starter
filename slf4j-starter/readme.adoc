The Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks (e.g. java.util.logging, logback, log4j) allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time.

== Build and Tests

  mvn compile

  # To test slf4j-simple
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=zemian.slf4jstater.Hello

  # To test logback
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=zemian.slf4jstater.Hello -P logback

== Simple Implementation

`slf4j-simple`

See https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/impl/SimpleLogger.html

To enable DEBUG:

  -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=DEBUG

== Logback Implementation

Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project, https://logback.qos.ch/reasonsToSwitch.html[picking up where log4j leaves off].
