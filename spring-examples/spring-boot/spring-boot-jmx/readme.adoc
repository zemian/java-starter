= Getting Started

This project requires JDK8 and Maven to build and run.

  export JAVA_HOME=`cygpath -wa $HOME/apps/jdk8`
  mvn spring-boot:run

Or you can run the executable jar by packaging first

  mvn package
  java -jar target/my-spring-boot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

= Spring Boot JMX

If you want to see "org.springframework.boot" JMX domain, you need to first enable the
"spring-boot-starter-actuator" module in pom file.

== JConsole JMX and Windows (IDE) PID

When running Spring Boot (or any Java program for that matter) inside your IDE on Windows, the
PID process of the JVM usually might recorded in wrong directory due to userid case insenstive
of the `%TMP%\hsperfdata_<userid>` folder. This will cause `jconsole` not able to see them in your
connection list. To work around this, you can try removing the `%TMP%\hsperfdata_<userid>` directory
and retry. Or you can find the direct PID value and connect it directly with `jconsole <PID>`.
