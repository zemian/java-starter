Flyway is an open-source database migration tool. It strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration.

It is based around just 7 basic commands: Migrate, Clean, Info, Validate, Undo, Baseline and Repair.

Migrations can be written in SQL (database-specific syntax (such as PL/SQL, T-SQL, ...) is supported) or Java (for advanced data transformations or dealing with LOBs).

	mvn flyway:migrate

See https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/firststeps/gradle


== Compare to Liquibase

The `liquibase` tool is a bigger tool compare to `flywaydb`. The `flywaydb` only manages schema changes, and it let you use native SQL as input, while the `liquibase`  uses XML table definitions. The `liquibase` can generate SQL for different databases!

Use `flywaydb` for single application with one database development.

Use `liquibase` for library or application that needs to support mulitple databases.
